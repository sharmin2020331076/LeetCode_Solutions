🧠 About Me:
Hi! I’m Sharmin Akther Juthi, a passionate learner with a sharp eye for design and logic.


🔍 I enjoy diving deep into competitive programming problems like palindrome checks, zigzag conversion, and string manipulation.


🎨 I also explore React TypeScript and Tailwind CSS outside of algorithmic challenges—crafting responsive and elegant UIs with cosmic vibes.
